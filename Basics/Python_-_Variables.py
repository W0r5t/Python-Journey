
#When Storing a Variable we use the = Sign to declare the value of the variable
x = 1
#Now We're going to print the Variable to make sure the Declaration has been properly Made
print (x)
#If The output Displays the integer 1 then we can continue our Journey

#We can also store multiple sets of data into the corresponding variables
v, b = 6, 9
#We also have to use a comma to declare the variables as seperate pieces of data
print(v,b)
